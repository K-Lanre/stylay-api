# Permission System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Permission Model
The system SHALL provide a comprehensive permission model that supports resource-action-conditional structure, enabling granular access control with ownership validation and conditional logic.

#### Scenario: Basic permission check
- **WHEN** a user requests access to a protected resource
- **THEN** the system SHALL evaluate the user's permissions based on resource, action, and conditional logic
- **AND** the system SHALL grant access only if the permission check passes all conditions

#### Scenario: Ownership validation
- **WHEN** a user attempts to modify a resource they don't own
- **THEN** the system SHALL deny access unless the user has administrative permissions
- **AND** the system SHALL log the unauthorized access attempt

#### Scenario: Conditional permission evaluation
- **WHEN** a permission has conditional logic (e.g., time-based, resource ownership)
- **THEN** the system SHALL evaluate all conditions before granting access
- **AND** the system SHALL deny access if any condition fails

### Requirement: Permission Categories and Groups
The system SHALL organize permissions into logical categories and groups for easy management and assignment.

#### Scenario: Permission group assignment
- **WHEN** an administrator assigns permissions by group
- **THEN** the system SHALL grant all permissions within that group
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain traceability of group-based assignments

#### Scenario: Cross-category permissions
- **WHEN** a user needs permissions from multiple categories
- **THEN** the system SHALL support assigning permissions across different groups
- **AND** the system SHALL prevent circular dependencies in permission inheritance

### Requirement: Resource Scope Validation
The system SHALL implement resource scope validation to ensure users can only access resources within their authorized scope.

#### Scenario: Own resource access
- **WHEN** a user with "own_resource" scope requests their own resource
- **THEN** the system SHALL grant access to the specific resource
- **AND** the system SHALL deny access to other users' resources

#### Scenario: All resource scope
- **WHEN** a user with "all_resources" scope requests any resource
- **THEN** the system SHALL grant access to all resources of that type
- **AND** the system SHALL verify the user has the appropriate role permissions

### Requirement: Conditional Permission Logic
The system SHALL support conditional permission logic for complex access control scenarios.

#### Scenario: Time-based permissions
- **WHEN** a permission has time-based restrictions
- **THEN** the system SHALL evaluate the current time against the permission conditions
- **AND** the system SHALL deny access outside the allowed time periods

#### Scenario: Resource state-based permissions
- **WHEN** a permission depends on resource state
- **THEN** the system SHALL evaluate the current state of the resource
- **AND** the system SHALL grant access only when conditions are met

### Requirement: Permission Inheritance and Delegation
The system SHALL support permission inheritance patterns and delegation mechanisms.

#### Scenario: Role-based inheritance
- **WHEN** a user has multiple roles
- **THEN** the system SHALL combine permissions from all roles
- **AND** the system SHALL resolve permission conflicts using explicit deny rules

#### Scenario: Permission delegation
- **WHEN** a user delegates permissions to another user
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a temporary permission grant
- **AND** the system SHALL revoke delegated permissions when the delegation period expires

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Permission Middleware
The existing permission middleware SHALL be enhanced to support conditional logic and resource scoping.

#### Scenario: Enhanced middleware functionality
- **WHEN** the permission middleware receives a request
- **THEN** it SHALL evaluate both role-based and granular permissions
- **AND** it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing role checks

### Requirement: Permission Service Integration
The PermissionService SHALL be extended with new methods for conditional permission checking and resource validation.

#### Scenario: Extended service methods
- **WHEN** calling permission checking methods
- **THEN** the service SHALL support conditional evaluation
- **AND** the service SHALL provide detailed permission evaluation results

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Simple Role-Based Checks
Simple role-based permission checks without conditional logic SHALL be deprecated in favor of the enhanced system.

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility
- **WHEN** existing code uses simple role checks
- **THEN** the system SHALL continue to support these checks
- **AND** the system SHALL log deprecation warnings for future migration

### Requirement: Hardcoded Permission Logic
Hardcoded permission logic in controllers SHALL be moved to the centralized permission system.

#### Scenario: Migration process
- **WHEN** hardcoded permission checks are found
- **THEN** they SHALL be replaced with centralized permission evaluations
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain the same security level during migration
