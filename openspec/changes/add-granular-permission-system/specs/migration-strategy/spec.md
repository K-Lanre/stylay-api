# Migration Strategy Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Role-to-Permission Migration Process
The system SHALL provide a structured migration process to convert existing role-based assignments to granular permission assignments.

#### Scenario: Initial permission mapping
- **WHEN** the migration process begins
- **THEN** the system SHALL analyze existing role assignments
- **AND** the system SHALL map each role to appropriate granular permissions
- **AND** the system SHALL create a migration report with changes and conflicts

#### Scenario: Automatic permission assignment
- **WHEN** migrating role assignments
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically assign corresponding granular permissions
- **AND** the system SHALL preserve existing access levels during migration
- **AND** the system SHALL handle edge cases with manual review flags

#### Scenario: Migration validation
- **WHEN** permission migration is complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate that users retain their original access levels
- **AND** the system SHALL generate a detailed validation report
- **AND** the system SHALL flag any access level inconsistencies for review

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility Framework
The system SHALL maintain full backward compatibility during and after the migration process.

#### Scenario: Dual permission checking
- **WHEN** a permission check is performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL check both role-based and granular permissions
- **AND** the system SHALL grant access if either permission type allows it
- **AND** the system SHALL log permission evaluation for debugging

#### Scenario: Gradual permission migration
- **WHEN** migrating from role-based to granular permissions
- **THEN** the system SHALL allow both permission types to coexist
- **AND** the system SHALL prioritize granular permissions when available
- **AND** the system SHALL fall back to role-based permissions as needed

#### Scenario: Role-based deprecation warnings
- **WHEN** role-based permissions are used
- **THEN** the system SHALL log deprecation warnings
- **AND** the system SHALL continue to support role-based access during transition
- **AND** the system SHALL provide guidance for migration to granular permissions

### Requirement: Migration Tools and Scripts
The system SHALL provide automated tools to assist with the migration process.

#### Scenario: Migration preview
- **WHEN** an administrator requests a migration preview
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate a detailed preview of proposed changes
- **AND** the system SHALL highlight potential access level changes
- **AND** the system SHALL provide options to adjust mappings before migration

#### Scenario: Incremental migration
- **WHEN** performing incremental migration
- **THEN** the system SHALL migrate users in batches
- **AND** the system SHALL allow rollback of individual batches if issues arise
- **AND** the system SHALL monitor system performance during migration

#### Scenario: Migration rollback
- **WHEN** a migration needs to be rolled back
- **THEN** the system SHALL restore original role-based assignments
- **AND** the system SHALL clean up any partially applied granular permissions
- **AND** the system SHALL log rollback actions for audit purposes

### Requirement: Data Migration and Validation
The system SHALL provide comprehensive data migration and validation capabilities.

#### Scenario: Database migration execution
- **WHEN** migrating permission data
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute database migrations safely
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain referential integrity during migration
- **AND** the system SHALL use transactions to ensure data consistency

#### Scenario: Permission consistency validation
- **AFTER** migration completion
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate permission consistency across all users
- **AND** the system SHALL identify and report any permission anomalies
- **AND** the system SHALL provide tools to fix identified issues

#### Scenario: Performance impact assessment
- **DURING** migration process
- **THEN** the system SHALL monitor performance metrics
- **AND** the system SHALL alert if performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds
- **AND** the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement: Migration Monitoring and Reporting
The system SHALL provide comprehensive monitoring and reporting during the migration process.

#### Scenario: Real-time migration status
- **WHEN** migration is in progress
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide real-time status updates
- **AND** the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion times
- **AND** the system SHALL flag any errors or warnings immediately

#### Scenario: Migration audit trail
- **THROUGHOUT** the migration process
- **THEN** the system SHALL maintain a comprehensive audit trail
- **AND** the system SHALL log all migration actions and decisions
- **AND** the system SHALL provide migration reports for compliance purposes

#### Scenario: Post-migration validation
- **AFTER** migration completion
- **THEN** the system SHALL perform comprehensive validation tests
- **AND** the system SHALL verify that all existing functionality works correctly
- **AND** the system SHALL generate a final migration completion report

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Permission Checking Logic
The existing permission checking logic SHALL be modified to support both role-based and granular permissions during migration.

#### Scenario: Hybrid permission evaluation
- **WHEN** evaluating permissions during migration
- **THEN** the system SHALL check both permission types
- **AND** the system SHALL prioritize granular permissions when available
- **AND** the system SHALL fall back to role-based permissions as needed

### Requirement: Error Handling for Migration Issues
Error handling SHALL be enhanced to provide detailed information about migration issues.

#### Scenario: Graceful error recovery
- **WHEN** migration encounters errors
- **THEN** the system SHALL log detailed error information
- **AND** the system SHALL continue with other users if possible
- **AND** the system SHALL provide clear instructions for resolving issues

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Simple Role-Based Migration
Simple role-based migration without granular permission consideration SHALL be deprecated.

#### Scenario: Legacy migration deprecation
- **WHEN** old migration tools are accessed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display deprecation warnings
- **AND** the system SHALL redirect users to the new granular permission migration tools
- **AND** the system SHALL provide guidance for using the new migration approach
