# Proposal: Implement Granular Permission System

## Why
The current application relies on simple role-based access control, which has become insufficient for managing complex access requirements. The existing permission system lacks granularity for conditional permissions (e.g., users can only modify their own resources), insufficient permission categories for modern marketplace operations, and comprehensive documentation for permission management. A new granular permission system is needed to enable precise control over administrative functions while maintaining backward compatibility.

## What Changes
- **Enhanced Permission Model**: Expand the current resource-action permission system to include conditional logic and resource scoping
- **Permission Categories**: Define comprehensive permission groups organized by functional areas (user management, data access, system configuration, transactions, etc.)
- **Role-Specific Permissions**: Create detailed permission mappings for Customer, Vendor, Sub-Admin, and Admin roles
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Maintain backward compatibility with role-based access while adding granular permissions for new features
- **Migration Framework**: Provide a structured approach for migrating from role-based to permission-based access control
- **Documentation Standards**: Implement comprehensive OpenSpec documentation for all permissions with clear examples and enforcement mechanisms

## Impact
- **Affected Capabilities**: 
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Vendor management and onboarding
  - Product and inventory management
  - Order processing and fulfillment
  - Admin dashboard and system configuration
  - Notification and communication systems
- **Affected Code**: Permission models, middleware, services, controllers, and routes
- **Database Changes**: Enhanced permission schema with conditional logic support
- **API Changes**: New permission management endpoints and enhanced authorization middleware
- **Breaking Changes**: None - backward compatibility maintained through hybrid approach

## Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Expand current permission system with conditional logic
2. **Phase 2**: Implement granular permission mappings for each role
3. **Phase 3**: Create migration tools for existing role assignments
4. **Phase 4**: Implement comprehensive testing and validation
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy with monitoring and rollback capabilities

## Success Criteria
- All existing functionality remains intact (backward compatibility)
- New granular permissions work correctly with conditional logic
- Clear documentation enables easy permission management
- Performance impact is minimal (<5% increase in authorization checks)
- Security is enhanced without compromising usability
- Migration process is smooth and reversible
